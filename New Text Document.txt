Hola Dinesh,

I have this url to test web services:
http://otu-srv.dyndns.ws/otu_app_srv/

user:        dinesh
passwd:   test_test

I setup a server to test database and web services.
You can access to manage MYSQL database 
http://otu-srv.dyndns.ws/phpmyadmin

I config a repository to track changes of the source code. 
It is a GIT repository.
Please let me know if you have working with this type of repository.

I need for you a pub rsa key to give you access to repository via SSH.
You will need to install git on your machine and then generate RSA key.


Steps for get repo are :

1) install ssh on your machine (when you install git, ssh are installed too)
2) generate rsa key (public and private )   help generar_rsa   (do not use passphrase )
3) move private key to  %HOME%/.ssh/id_rsa
4) send me by email id_rsa.pub for add it on server 

For use repo:

git clone ssh://dinesh@otu-srv.dyndns.ws/otu_app_srv.git


git add *                                                                o     git add --all        
git commit -m "text to describe changes"
git push

NOTE: just first push you must sent it like: git push -u origin master 
           then you can use git push 



git clone ssh://dinesh@otu-srv.dyndns.ws/otu_app_srv.git
